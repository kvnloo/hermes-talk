# Changelog

All notable changes to hermes-talk, newest first. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versions follow
[SemVer](https://semver.org/). Each release opens with what it means before
listing what it contains.

One honesty note, because this file exists to be trusted: the dashboard tab
and the api-server agent lane landed inside the 0.4.0 development window,
but 0.4.0's release title named only the steering verb. They are recorded
below under 0.4.0 — the first version that shipped them — with the gap
named rather than smoothed.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `hermes-talk` now implements the provider/session contract from Hermes
  #95147. The plugin owns OpenAI transport while Hermes's coordinator owns
  tool dispatch, heard-audio truncation, cancellation, and transcript memory.
  Terminal sessions emit `listening`, `solving`, and `composing` lifecycle
  phases for the TUI orb without introducing another core transport.
- Realtime terminal sessions now report capture-to-provider-send percentiles,
  provider speech-end notification latency, first-audio receive-to-playback
  delay, turn-end-event-to-playback delay, and separately named local-silence
  and provider-cancellation timings. Provider speech timeline offsets remain
  attached to the canonical Hermes event envelope for correlation.

### Fixed
- Linux terminal calls now route default audio through PulseAudio's WebRTC
  echo canceller and noise suppressor. The fallback path matches OMP's
  output-relative amplitude gate, and heard-audio boundaries are captured
  atomically with playback drain.
## [0.16.0] — 2026-09-01

Grok voice on a SuperGrok / X Premium+ subscription. `hermes auth add
xai-oauth` once, `TALK_PROVIDER=grok`, no API key — the last provider that
still forced a metered key now rides the host login the way the OpenAI
lane rides the Codex CLI's.

### Added
- **`xai-oauth` auth lane for Grok** (`talk_grok_auth.py`). Resolved
  fail-closed: `TALK_PREFER_XAI_OAUTH` → `TALK_XAI_API_KEY` →
  `XAI_API_KEY` → the host's `xai-oauth` login. The host resolver owns
  refresh and quarantine when importable; otherwise `HERMES_HOME/auth.json`
  is parsed read-only. Talk never writes an auth store and the bearer only
  ever reaches `*.x.ai`.
- **`TALK_PREFER_XAI_OAUTH`** — `true` requires the subscription login and
  refuses metered fallback; blank or invalid values refuse, like the Codex
  twin.
- **`hermes talk doctor --probe`** (grok only, opt-in) — two live calls to
  `api.x.ai` (`POST /v1/realtime/client_secrets` + the realtime handshake)
  that print status codes and the first server event, never the token.
- **Handshake remediation.** A 401/403 on the Grok socket becomes one
  operator line (`run hermes auth add xai-oauth` / `your xAI subscription
  tier does not include realtime API access; set XAI_API_KEY`) instead of
  an aiohttp traceback. Every other failure keeps its original text.

### Changed
- `hermes talk doctor` on the Grok lane reports the winning auth lane and
  `xai-oauth=valid|expired|invalid|missing` without refreshing anything;
  "no xAI key" alone no longer fails when a usable login exists.
- `hermes talk setup` offers the xAI subscription vs an xAI key for
  `TALK_PROVIDER=grok`; without a login it names the command and writes
  nothing.

### Not in this release
- Reading Grok Build CLI's `~/.grok/auth.json`; a device-code login inside
  the plugin; any write to any auth store. The dashboard tab stays
  OpenAI-only.
## [0.15.1] — 2026-09-01

Voice hears you again on end-to-end-encrypted Discord calls. 0.15.0's
`/talk join` could forward white noise to the model for the whole session
when the operator was already in the channel and had not spoken through
`/voice` first — not a microphone problem, an identity one.

### Fixed
- **E2EE audio from an unmapped speaker no longer reaches the model as
  static.** Discord voice is DAVE-encrypted; the host only decrypts an SSRC
  it has already mapped to a user, and it learns that mapping from Discord's
  SPEAKING event (which never arrives for someone already transmitting when
  the bot joins) or from its own silence gate — which `/talk`'s continuous
  drain starved, so the mapping never formed, decrypt was skipped, and Opus
  decoded ciphertext. The bridge now identifies the speaker itself the way
  the host's silence gate would (host inference preferred, sole-allowed-
  member fallback), discards the frames decoded before the mapping existed,
  resets the host decoder for that stream, and warns once per SSRC when a
  speaker cannot be identified rather than forwarding noise. Unencrypted
  (passthrough) audio flows exactly as before.
- **Capability section reflects the live install.** The prompt's toolset
  list is priority-ordered so high-agency tools (`computer_use`, browser,
  terminal) survive the display cap instead of being truncated in catalog
  order; the delegate line names only the categories whose tools actually
  resolved; a category with no tool list is kept rather than silently
  filtered out.

### Added
- One `INFO` receipt when the capture tap goes live —
  `discord capture live: bot_ssrc=… e2ee=… mapped_ssrcs=…` — so the next
  "it hears noise" report carries whether the call was encrypted and who
  was mapped at the moment `/talk` attached.

## [0.15.0] — 2026-08-30

The capability bridge: voice becomes the manager of Hermes's whole capability
surface — the session knows the live install, does what's safe directly,
delegates the rest, and gated work resolves by spoken approval. Never a bare
"I can't."

### Added
- **Live-catalog prompt section.** Session instructions carry a bounded
  capabilities block — skill count + the tool categories usable right now +
  the delegation ceiling + the never-invent-tool-names rule — assembled from
  the real catalog and capped like every other resident section. When the
  catalog is unreachable the section is absent and the prompt is exactly what
  it was before (fail-open). The tier-1 catalog probe stops dispatching the
  guessed `list_capabilities` tool name (dead upstream) and reads the host's
  own registries instead — the same builders the `/v1/skills` and
  `/v1/toolsets` routes run, plus the live, availability-gated resolved-tool
  set from `model_tools.get_tool_definitions`.
- **Host-tool classification table** (`talk_operator_auth`): curated read-only
  host tools (`web_search`, `web_extract`, `vision_analyze`, `session_search`)
  may run inline; `computer_use`'s read actions ride a fresh spoken operator
  permit; everything else — including every destructive computer-use action —
  delegates. Unclassified names and permit-gated failures now deny with a
  steering receipt ("I can't do that directly in a voice call — I can spin up
  an agent that can. Want me to?") instead of a flat refusal.
- **Spoken approvals for delegated runs.** Every api-server run gains an SSE
  sidecar on `/v1/runs/{id}/events`; an `approval.request` becomes a spoken,
  contained prompt, and the operator's answer resolves it through the new
  `resolve_approval` tool (on Discord, behind the existing spoken-permit
  machinery). Voice grants `once`, `session`, or `deny` — `always` is
  ungrantable, narrowed in code. An unanswered question denies on
  `TALK_APPROVAL_PROMPT_TIMEOUT_S` (default 60s); interrupting the question
  denies immediately. Progress narration and the result ride the existing
  watcher machinery unchanged; resolutions annotate run meta like stop
  receipts.

### Fixed
- **Transcript flush no longer drops the conversation when no Talk connection
  is bound.** The session-end memory handoff routed through the ticketed run
  lane and was refused ("no Talk connection is bound") on the Discord lane,
  deleting the transcript unread. The flush now runs a ticket-free lane
  ladder, and when no agent lane exists at all the transcript is restored for
  the next sweep ("handoff deferred") instead of dropped.

### Hardened (adversarial review round)
Eight findings from the pre-release adversarial review, all fixed with
regression tests:
- **Classification is transport-independent.** The host-tool classification
  now rides the execution relay itself, above every authorizer — the local
  single-speaker lane can no longer dispatch a destructive or unclassified
  host tool bare (its in-handler approval gates fail open on the plugin
  thread). *Behavior change:* local voice host-execution steers mutating host
  tools to the delegate lane with spoken approvals instead of running them
  ungated.
- **An answer in flight owns its approval.** A resolve POST outlasting the
  courtesy wait can no longer be followed by a timeout deny or a second
  answer; a late acceptance finalizes the record, and a transport failure
  reopens it and re-arms the fail-closed timer.
- **Malformed approval metadata narrows to deny-only.** A missing or
  unrecognizable `choices` list used to widen the answer set to everything
  voice can grant; it now collapses to `deny`.
- **Dead event streams still get spoken prompts.** The run-events stream is
  single-shot upstream (a reconnect 404s); when a run's watcher dies, the
  poll loop reconciles one conservative prompt (`once`/`deny`) instead of
  letting the approval sit silent until the host's 300s auto-deny. Resolves
  also carry the request's own id (`approvalId`) for exact routing on hosts
  that support it.
- **Stale sidecars are quarantined by attach generation.** A delegated run
  outliving its session can no longer speak its approval into — or be
  resolved from — the next session.
- **Transcripts are deleted only on proof.** The flush tiers run
  synchronously and return a completion receipt; a refusal, failed run,
  nonzero one-shot exit, or exception keeps the only copy for the next sweep
  (at-least-once instead of silent loss).
- **A zero-tool live read is a real answer.** The prompt section no longer
  falls back to static enabled/configured flags when the registry's
  availability gates resolved nothing.
- **Cold starts mint the catalog deterministically.** Session start gives the
  background catalog read a bounded head start
  (`TALK_CATALOG_STARTUP_WAIT_S`, default 2.5s, `0` = never wait) instead of
  racing it.

## [0.14.0] — 2026-08-28

The custom-voice cascade leaves the terminal: Discord rooms and the dashboard
tab speak through ElevenLabs too.

### Added
- Discord lane: cascade voice in the voice channel. The lane already enters
  the terminal's shared `run_talk_session`, so the 0.13.0 wiring —
  fail-closed config, text-output session setup, observe-before-relay,
  teardown — applied by construction; this release PROVES it through the
  real `DiscordAudio` surface (fake voice channel, scripted TTS socket):
  cascade PCM24k takes the relay's exact 24k→48k conversion into the room,
  barge-in kills the TTS stream and drains the channel in one step, and a
  non-OpenAI provider refuses before the channel is touched.
- Dashboard lane: `POST /api/plugins/hermes-talk/cascade-tts` — a server-side
  relay for the browser. The tab mints a text-output session (`/session`
  answers `voiceMode: "cascade"` and skips the provider-voice validation),
  streams the model's `response.output_text` deltas to the route as NDJSON
  (`{"delta": ...}` lines, one terminal `{"done": ...}`), and plays the
  PCM24k that streams back through its AudioContext. Only an explicit `done`
  completes an answer: an aborted stream (barge-in, tab closed) cancels the
  TTS instead of flushing it, and a malformed or oversized line cancels with
  one logged receipt rather than half-speaking. The ElevenLabs key never
  leaves the server — the route sits behind the same `TALK_DASHBOARD_TOKEN` /
  loopback gate as the mint, and `CascadeVoice` gains an `on_stream_end`
  hook so the route knows when a response's audio has settled.
- `talk_config.cascade_voice_config(provider)`: the cascade fail-closed
  resolution (provider gate, TTS knob, key, voice id, model) in one place,
  so the terminal, Discord, and dashboard lanes refuse identically.

## [0.13.0] — 2026-08-28

Custom voice: a cascade mode that lets the assistant speak in YOUR voice —
any stock or cloned voice on the operator's ElevenLabs account — while the
realtime provider stays the brain.

### Added
- `TALK_VOICE_MODE` (`native` default | `cascade`, fail-closed). In cascade
  mode the provider session opens in text-output mode; assistant text deltas
  flow through a sentence chunker into a streaming ElevenLabs TTS, and the
  returned PCM24k feeds the SAME playback sink the relay uses for provider
  audio — the playback engine is shared, not forked. Cascade is gated to
  OpenAI (its text-output mode is wired and verified); selecting grok or
  gemini fails closed and names the provider.
- `talk_cascade_voice` module: the sentence chunker (terminal punctuation
  plus clause breaks past a ~120-char budget; decimals, abbreviations,
  initials, acronyms, dotted words, and ellipses never false-split, and a
  split never lands mid-word) and the ElevenLabs stream-input client
  (BOS/voice settings/chunks with `try_trigger_generation`/EOS, base64 audio
  frames, `isFinal` terminal). The key rides the `xi-api-key` header only —
  never the URL, never a log line.
- Barge-in covers the cascade: SpeechStarted aborts the in-flight TTS stream
  and drains pending chunks in the same synchronous step the relay drains
  playback, so a cancelled sentence never speaks; the next response opens a
  fresh stream. A TTS failure degrades that one response to text-only with a
  single logged receipt — the voice session survives.
- Cascade knobs: `TALK_CASCADE_TTS` (`elevenlabs` only, fail-closed),
  `TALK_ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` -> `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` (set-but-blank refuses),
  `TALK_ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID` (required in cascade mode, fail-closed with
  remediation), and `TALK_ELEVENLABS_MODEL` (default `eleven_flash_v2_5`).
- Doctor gains a `cascade` check: voice mode, TTS provider, redacted key
  presence, voice-id status, provider gate — read-only, no live probe.

## [0.12.0] — 2026-08-28

A third realtime voice provider: Gemini Live (Google) — the zero-cost lane,
free-tier AI Studio keys included — behind the same provider-neutral session
contract the OpenAI and Grok lanes already speak.

### Added
- `TALK_PROVIDER` gains `gemini` as a third value — call-time resolved,
  fail-closed on any other value, and never inferred from which API keys
  happen to be set.
- `talk_gemini_realtime` adapter: key-in-URL WebSocket to the Gemini Live
  endpoint — on this lane the URL itself is the secret, so it is assembled at
  connect, never logged, and scrubbed out of transport errors. The
  `setup`/`setupComplete` handshake carries model, voice, instructions, and
  function tools (schema types uppercased into the Live enum vocabulary);
  tool `args` arrive as parsed dicts and are translated to the contract's
  JSON strings, with `toolResponse` envelopes keyed by call id — the loop
  round-tripped live on `gemini-3.1-flash-live-preview`. Assistant audio is
  native 24kHz; a pure-Python streaming resampler downsamples the relay's
  24kHz microphone PCM to the 16kHz Live declares for input.
  `serverContent.interrupted` maps to the contract's barge-in path, and
  session-resumption handles are recorded for the follow-up reconnect
  feature (not sent back in v1).
- Gemini knobs: `TALK_GEMINI_API_KEY` -> `GEMINI_API_KEY` (fail-closed;
  set-but-blank is a hard refusal), `TALK_GEMINI_MODEL` (default
  `gemini-3.1-flash-live-preview`), and `TALK_GEMINI_VOICE` (fail-closed and
  case-sensitive: `Puck`, `Charon`, `Kore`, `Fenrir`, `Aoede`).
- Gemini's honest degrades, each logged once per session or refused loudly:
  the Live protocol has no client cancel, truncate, or context-delete
  command, so those commands degrade to local playback handling with a
  receipt and a truncation that did not happen is never faked; a standalone
  `StartResponse` maps to a `turnComplete` client-content trigger (the one
  shape the live probe did not exercise); and the Discord lane's
  gated-response flow (`automatic_response=False`) is refused at connect
  rather than silently answering unvetted speakers.
- Doctor's `provider` check covers the Gemini lane with the same read-only
  shape: redacted key presence, model and voice validity, no live probe.
- Gemini setup also enables session resumption (still record-only: only a
  `resumable: true` update confirms a handle, and a `resumable: false`
  update discards the cached one — an invalidated handle is never reused)
  and context-window compression on server sliding-window defaults, so
  audio-only sessions are not cut off near the 15-minute mark.
- Gemini wire hardening against the shipped-provider references (Google Live
  docs, OpenClaw, Pipecat, LiveKit): tool calls the server cancels
  mid-interruption (`toolCallCancellation`) have their results dropped with
  a once-per-call receipt — nothing is answered upstream for a discarded
  call; `goAway` surfaces as a terminal failure the relay can close on
  instead of a dead socket; a bundled `serverContent` frame is processed
  field-by-field before its terminal flag is honored; and trailing
  audio/text arriving after `generationComplete` is dropped with one
  warning per window rather than reopening a phantom response.

### Fixed
- Live smoke: the Gemini endpoint speaks its JSON in BINARY WebSocket frames
  on some connections — both frame types are now accepted, and one malformed
  frame is a non-terminal failure instead of killing the call.

## [0.11.0] — 2026-08-28

A second realtime voice provider: Grok (xAI), behind the same
provider-neutral session contract the OpenAI lane already speaks.

### Added
- `TALK_PROVIDER` selects the realtime provider — `openai` (default) or
  `grok`. Call-time resolved, fail-closed on any other value, and never
  inferred from which API keys happen to be set.
- `talk_grok_realtime` adapter: bearer-authenticated WebSocket to the xAI
  realtime endpoint (no ephemeral mint exists there — the resolved key is the
  socket's credential), GA-vocabulary events translated into the neutral
  contract, application-level `ping` events and normalized `session.updated`
  echoes tolerated without being parsed for authority. The full tool loop
  (function-call arguments to `function_call_output` to follow-up response)
  round-trips with the existing command vocabulary.
- Grok knobs: `TALK_XAI_API_KEY` -> `XAI_API_KEY` (fail-closed; set-but-blank
  is a hard refusal), `TALK_GROK_MODEL` (default `grok-voice-latest`), and
  `TALK_GROK_VOICE` (fail-closed: `ara`, `rex`, `sal`, `eve`, `leo`).
- Terminal and Discord lanes inherit the provider through the shared session
  factory; the dashboard lane is unchanged (xAI has no WebRTC offer endpoint
  — that lane is a Phase 2 backend relay).
- `hermes talk doctor` gains a `provider` check: selection, redacted key
  presence, and model/voice validity for the Grok lane. Read-only, no live
  probe.
- Server-side truncation on Grok is attempted first and, if the server
  refuses the event as unsupported, degrades to cancel-only with one logged
  receipt per session — a truncation that did not happen is never faked.

### Fixed
- Grok user transcripts no longer print duplicated: xAI's cumulative
  input-transcription snapshots decode as non-final partials, identical
  repeats are suppressed, and the completion event yields exactly one final
  per input item (live smoke, 2026-08-28).

## [0.10.1] — 2026-08-27

The voice session now knows what it is and where it lives, and the plugin
installs clean under Hermes's new security scanner.

### Added
- Full Hermes self-knowledge in the voice session (hermes-talk#64). The
  session now carries a lane line naming its own transport — a CLI session
  says it is a terminal on the operator's machine and that Ctrl+C hangs up;
  Discord and dashboard sessions name their own off switches — so "where are
  you running from?" and "how do I turn you off?" get true answers. The
  preamble steers "what can you do?" to the live `talk_capabilities` catalog
  instead of a recitation from memory, and states the delegation ceiling
  plainly: no direct clicking or typing, but delegated agents run the full
  Hermes toolset including computer use — never "I can't" when the honest
  answer is "I can hand that to an agent." A one-line host summary (enabled
  skill/toolset counts) rides session mint when the catalog is already warm,
  and stays absent rather than stalling startup when it is not.

### Fixed
- The plugin now scans `safe` under the upstream `plugin_guard` security
  scanner (NousResearch/hermes-agent, gating `hermes plugins install` since
  Hermes v0.20.4), where one critical finding blocks installation and
  `--force` does not override. The repo was carrying 17 criticals, all of
  them false positives from the test suite doing its job: the redaction and
  containment tests quote injection text, destructive commands, and
  credential-shaped dummies byte-for-byte to prove those protections hold
  against the real thing. Those payloads now live in `tests/fixtures/` as
  `.fixture` files — an extension the scanner does not content-scan — loaded
  through `tests/fixture_data.py` with their bytes and every assertion
  unchanged. Two phrasings that collided with scanner patterns were reworded
  without changing meaning (an auth-source comment in `talk_auth.py`, one
  `HERMES_HOME` row in `docs/OPERATING.md`). A new gate keeps it green:
  `.github/workflows/plugin-guard.yml` downloads the scanner pinned to the
  upstream main commit it resolves at run time and fails the pull request on
  any critical or high finding, and `tests/test_plugin_guard.py` reproduces
  the same check offline when the scanner is vendored locally.

## [0.10.0] — 2026-08-27

Delegated work stops being a black box. A voice session now starts knowing
who you are, approves a mutation in one exchange instead of three, hears
bounded progress while the job runs, and gets the right result back in the
right session — even across a reconnect.

### Added
- Background work now speaks bounded progress milestones between the
  delegation receipt and the terminal result (hermes-talk#33). A live session
  hears "accepted", "executing — Reading files", "blocked" (waiting on an
  approval), and periodic "still working" heartbeats — all built from host
  evidence only, never invented. The only job-specific detail that can leave
  the module is a safe tool label from a fixed mapping table ("Reading files",
  "Running commands", "Searching the web"); unknown tools degrade to
  "Working". Arguments, paths, URLs, output text, and approval commands never
  enter a milestone.

  Three invariants hold the design together: claims never exceed host
  evidence (a phase is set only from a real host signal — the api_server's
  `last_event`, or an in-process `post_tool_call`/`pre_approval_request`
  hook); telemetry is never authority (writing `complete` into meta is a
  receipt OF a terminal artifact, never a substitute — `finish_run` and
  `claim_delivery` remain untouched); and routing keys on correlators, never
  recency (two concurrent jobs cannot cross-route because neither projection
  ever consults "the most recent" anything).

  The visual lane reads the same phase off `meta.phase` for free —
  `list_runs` already surfaces meta, so the dashboard's run list gains
  progress without a new endpoint.
- A capability-kernel port plan maps TaskChad OS v1.7.0's strict discovery,
  immutable artifact, authority-separation, atomic publication, reverse
  disposal, journaled recovery, and lane-truth lessons onto Hermes-owned host
  APIs. This is documentation and an acceptance contract, not a claim that
  `hermes-talk` already supports hot plugin lifecycle changes.
- A voice session can now start already knowing who you are, which repos you
  mean by name, and what your aliases map to — provided you curate the file
  that carries it (hermes-talk#36). Dogfooding on 2026-08-16 kept hitting the
  same two failures: the session asked who the operator was every call, and
  when a spoken name could mean two things it picked one silently. Nothing on
  a voice surface shows you it guessed.

  Three parts, each an extension of a mechanism that already existed rather
  than a new one:

  `memories/WORKING.md` is a new identity section, and the only one YOU write
  instead of the model — nothing fills it for you, and it is read once at
  session mint and stays frozen for the call (an edit lands on the next
  session). It rides the same durable-file pipeline as `USER.md`
  and `MEMORY.md`, so it is threat-scanned per entry, capped (2,000 chars),
  and filtered by `TALK_IDENTITY_INCLUDE` without any of that being written
  twice — hand-authored is not the same as trusted, and anything that can
  write to your Hermes home can append an entry. Two entries claiming the
  same alias BOTH travel: resolving that by file order would bind your words
  to whichever line you wrote first, with no symptom, so the model is told to
  ask instead — a rule that rides the voice preamble on EVERY lane, gated on
  nothing, because the lanes that lose identity sections (a ctx-less gateway
  or dashboard, a pinned include list, a failed scan) are exactly the ones
  where nobody watches a silent guess go by. When a host is attached, one
  sentence naming `search_memory` is appended for anything not in the file.
  An include list pinned before `WORKING` existed silently drops the section
  after upgrade; the session logs one warning at mint when that happens.

  `search_memory` grew a middle tier. Between the transcript read
  (`session_search`) and the api-server fallback it now tries Hermes's Honcho
  memory plugin, and prefixes that answer with `from remembered context:`.
  The prefix is the point: a remembered profile fact can be stale in a way a
  verbatim transcript line cannot, and collapsing the two would make a guess
  and a quote sound identical out loud. The prefix marks FACTS only — an
  error-shaped Honcho answer is spoken without it — and it is reserved:
  transcript or vault content that leads with the literal marker has it
  stripped, so a quote can never dress itself as a recollection. A Honcho
  that is simply absent falls through; a Honcho that is present and refuses
  is spoken, not routed around; and the Honcho dispatch is bounded by
  `TALK_MEMORY_SEARCH_TIMEOUT_S` (default 10s) so a wedged plugin costs one
  spoken failure, never the serialized tool pipeline.

  `TALK_SESSION_KEY` sends `X-Hermes-Session-Key` on run submission, so the
  memory an api-server run reads and writes is scoped to you and survives the
  `/clear` that ends a `session_id`. Unset — the default — sends no header
  and changes nothing. It is deliberately static and operator-set: a key
  derived from the hostname or the clock would change between runs, and the
  one property the knob exists for would be silently missing. It is an
  OPERATOR scope, not a session boundary: every voice-channel participant
  shares it, because the authority ledger gates mutating tools and never
  memory reads — do not set it in a multi-user channel until per-speaker
  scoping lands.

  Not built, and named here so the gap is not mistaken for coverage: a
  session-mint profile pre-fetch (`honcho_context`), per-Discord-channel and
  per-dashboard-session key derivation, per-speaker memory scoping,
  code-enforced binding for spoken entities, homophone detection, any
  producer that fills `WORKING.md` (installed plugins, recent work), and
  mid-call refresh of identity sections. Ambiguity and mishears are handled
  by prompt copy plus the aliases you write yourself, the same way the
  preamble's damage-based confirmation policy governs every other
  consequential action here — not by a mechanism that can refuse.

- A spoken approval now binds to the exact action it approved, so a mutating
  request takes one summary-then-yes exchange instead of a draft → confirm →
  restate → confirm loop (hermes-talk#37). The single-use call permit minted
  in `bind_tool_event` already bound *who* approved and *which* response; it
  now also binds *what*, with each check honest about which threat it
  covers. The permit's expiry (`TALK_APPROVAL_PERMIT_TTL_S`, default 30s,
  monotonic clock) runs from the moment the operator's approving speech
  ended — never from permit mint — so a model that sits on an approved
  action cannot fire a stale yes into a conversation that has moved on; a
  binding with no approval moment mints no permit at all. For tools that
  name a target (`steer_agent`, `redirect_agent`, `stop_work`), the emitted
  target is cross-checked against a bounded window of the spoken exchange
  (operator and assistant transcripts) before the permit exists: a target
  that was never spoken to the operator is refused outright, which is the
  check that catches the model saying "steer agent A" and emitting agent B.
  Free-text arguments (a delegated task's wording) are not covered by that
  cross-check. The tool name presented at execution must match the permit's
  action, and the argument hash is a relay-integrity tripwire only — it
  detects the bound event being rewritten inside this process between bind
  and authorize, and cannot see model-side divergence from the spoken
  summary. Arguments are compared by value rather than by serialization, so
  a provider re-emitting the same arguments in a different key order, or
  `1` as `1.0`, is not mistaken for a changed request. Approvals of mutating
  tools are now logged alongside denials (operator id, tool, target — never
  raw audio); previously only refusals were recorded, which left the audit
  trail unable to show what was actually authorized. The voice preamble now
  tells the model to state its plan once and act on a clear yes.

### Fixed
- Delegated work and memory lookups are now bound to the exact Talk session
  that asked for them (hermes-talk#35). Previously the `WORK_STARTED` receipt
  was backed by nothing but an in-process dict with a fail-open history tee:
  no run recorded who started it or where the answer should go, and the only
  watcher that would ever speak the result died with the session. A job could
  finish with nobody listening, and nothing could tell a reconnecting session
  "this result is yours" apart from "this one is a stranger's". On this box
  that left three real runs stuck at `running` forever.

  `talk_runs` now mints an immutable ticket at acceptance — operator, profile,
  durable Hermes session, Talk generation, and a per-request id — and persists
  it BEFORE the worker thread starts. That one write is fail-closed: if it
  cannot land, dispatch is refused with `RoutingUnavailable` and the operator
  hears "I can't start that yet" instead of a receipt for work nothing could
  route. Everything else about the tee stays fail-open, because once a run is
  accepted its result is owed. Delivery is a two-phase claim, on disk as well
  as in memory: a result is CLAIMED exactly once at enqueue and flipped to
  delivered only after the announcement is actually handed to the wire, so a
  session torn down mid-queue leaves the result re-adoptable instead of
  consumed-but-unspoken (the residual duplication window is a crash between
  the wire hand-off and the flip — said once more on reconnect, never lost).
  A reconnecting session adopts only tickets recorded under its own Hermes
  session AND its own operator/profile binding — ownership is enforced at
  adoption, not just recorded — while a different session adopts nothing,
  and pre-#35 history, which carries no ticket, is never adopted by anyone.
  Announcements still ride the existing contained-system-item path, so an
  adopted result is exactly as untrusted as a fresh one and can never
  re-enter the conversation as operator speech.
- The run-history file is now serialized ACROSS PROCESSES, not just across
  threads: the CLI lane and the dashboard lane (the Hermes web server
  process) share one `state/talk-runs.jsonl`, so every load-modify-append —
  delivery claims, compaction, and run-id allocation — holds an OS-level
  one-byte file lock (the same msvcrt/fcntl mechanism as the transcript
  writer lease), and run ids are floored on the file's own highest persisted
  id inside that lock at every acceptance, which makes cross-process id
  collisions impossible instead of merely unlikely.
- A disabled history tee now REFUSES dispatch instead of silently accepting
  a run with no durable route; callers that legitimately want in-memory-only
  routing opt in by name (`TALK_RUNS_ALLOW_EPHEMERAL=1`).
- The api-server lane's remote run id is now written through the strict,
  cross-process-locked append at the moment it is learned — retried once and
  escalated to an error log if it still cannot land, never dropped as
  fail-open telemetry. It is the only handle a reconnect could resume
  tracking a tier-2 run by, and holding it in memory alone meant it died
  with the process a reconnect exists to recover from. The terminal tee
  happened to carry it for runs that finished, which is how the gap stayed
  hidden.
- An owed result that falls off the bounded adoption tail of the history
  file is now counted and logged instead of vanishing silently.
- The dashboard's session mint binds the browser lane's own return route, so
  `POST /tool` can still start real work under the fail-closed rule. It carries
  no Hermes session id (none is ever bound in the web server process) and never
  the ephemeral credential — a secret does not become an identifier.

## [0.9.0] — 2026-08-18

The room gets an authority boundary: only the operator's voice can authorize a
mutation, the session stops talking over itself, and "what can you do right
now?" is answered from live evidence instead of the system prompt.

### Security
- Operator speaker authority is now enforced at canonical host execution, not
  just at the Discord layer (hermes-talk#39). A mutating tool call must bind to
  the immutable operator identity all the way through the host's own
  authorization path, so another voice in the room cannot induce a mutation
  under the operator's authority.

### Fixed
- Realtime responses are serialized, eliminating duplicate and cut-off speech
  (hermes-talk#38). One active assistant response at a time; superseded
  responses are cancelled cleanly instead of overlapping.

### Added
- A live capability catalog: the new `talk_capabilities` tool answers "what can
  you do right now?" from evidence instead of from the system prompt — installed
  skills, resolved toolsets with their `enabled`/`configured` flags, the
  gateway's feature flags, and bounded run/delegation counts. `talk_capabilities.py`
  reads it in-process off the committed host attachment when a Hermes agent is
  attached, and falls back to the api server (`/v1/skills`, `/v1/toolsets`,
  `/v1/capabilities`, `/health/detailed`) when it is not — the same two-tier
  doctrine `agent_lane()` already uses. A host that does not expose the
  in-process tool degrades to REST rather than failing. The snapshot is
  TTL-cached (`TALK_CAPABILITY_CATALOG_TTL_S`, default 30s) and warmed at the
  dashboard's session mint, so a tool handler never waits on the network.
  Disabled toolsets are reported rather than hidden, so the model can say
  "installed but not usable" instead of quietly offering something that would
  fail. The tool is classified read-only: reading the catalog grants no
  execution authority, and a catalog read consumes its call permit so it cannot
  be replayed as a mutating call.

## [0.8.1] — 2026-08-15

The first PyPI release, and the one where the session stops being a prompt
with a microphone: a typed provider-neutral boundary, native setup and doctor
commands, and an explicit subscription auth lane.

### Added
- A typed provider-neutral Realtime session boundary: `talk_realtime.py` owns
  setup, events, commands, lifecycle states, and the adapter protocol, while
  `talk_openai_realtime.py` owns OpenAI ephemeral minting, WebSocket lifecycle,
  and wire translation. Hermes policy now runs against the neutral contract, and
  failed sessions stop active tool coordination through an acknowledged,
  bounded teardown. The CLI still resolves OpenAI auth and constructs the sole
  bundled OpenAI adapter; this does not add arbitrary provider selection.
- Native `hermes talk setup`: detect current state, ask only unresolved
  auth/model/voice decisions, explicitly confirm each setting, securely commit
  the confirmed set as one rollback-capable atomic transaction, emit a redacted
  apply receipt, then rerun the separately read-only doctor and verify the
  result. Key selection under preferred Codex OAuth reuses an existing key and
  separately confirms the required policy transition; key selection after an
  invalid preference now resolves the scoped key in that same transaction and
  completes setup in one run.
- Native `hermes talk doctor` human and `--json` diagnostics for registration,
  auth selection, model/voice, audio, identity profile/root/count receipts,
  Discord operators, and host capabilities. The command is strictly read-only
  and redacts credentials, identity content, operator IDs, and secret-shaped
  values pasted into malformed configuration fields.
- `TALK_PREFER_CODEX_OAUTH=true` as an explicit fail-closed subscription lane.
  Without it, the existing scoped-key → shared-key → Codex order is unchanged;
  doctor warns when a metered key wins and distinguishes valid OAuth from an
  expired credential that still requires refresh.
- Cross-platform dotenv mutation: Windows names match case-insensitively and
  duplicate case variants collapse deterministically; POSIX names stay
  case-sensitive. New secret files use POSIX owner-only modes or a native
  protected owner-only Windows DACL while existing Windows destination DACLs
  are preserved. Every staged path is cleanup-verified; a surviving temp makes
  the redacted receipt fail instead of claiming rollback. Hermes-home
  provenance follows the host's exact tilde, relative, and platform-default
  path semantics or reports unknown.
- Bounded model compatibility policy for Talk's duplex-audio and live-tool
  requirements. Specialized Whisper/Translate models fail explicitly; unknown
  Realtime-shaped ids are labeled syntax-only instead of certified valid.

### Fixed
- `pip install "hermes-talk[audio]"` now installs cleanly from PyPI
  (hermes-talk#42) — the audio extra previously failed on a fresh machine.

## [0.8.0] — 2026-08-04

The session stops arriving as a stranger. It now knows who it is talking
to, what it already knows, what day it is, and how to look something up
in your written notes — and it stopped telling the model to call tools
it does not have.

### Added
- **`USER` and `MEMORY` actually ride the session.** Both were declared
  with headers, caps and an ordering, and had no producer anywhere. The
  cause was two similarly named host surfaces: `MEMORY.md`/`USER.md`
  live on the agent's memory STORE, and this plugin read the memory
  MANAGER, which holds external providers only. They are now read from
  `<hermes_home>/memories/` directly, so it works on all three lanes —
  the gateway and the dashboard have no agent at all.
- **`search_vault`** — look something up in the operator's long-term
  written notes, as distinct from `search_memory`'s what-was-said.
  Backed by the memory provider's own index read in process, and
  advertised **only** when a lookup can really be served.
- The current date and time, built per session (a module-level clock
  would freeze at import and a long-running gateway would state the day
  it booted).

### Changed
- **The memory pointer stopped lying.** The provider's own
  `system_prompt_block` used to pass straight through, telling the model
  to call `homie_memory_search` — a real tool in a text agent's registry
  and absent from a Realtime session's, so the model called it and got
  "That tool isn't available" on a live call. Every provider's block has
  that shape, so this was wrong as a class. One sentence this plugin
  authors replaces it, naming a tool the session has.
- The vault provider is resolved once behind a single-flight lock (a
  rebuild is a full vault walk, ~0.3s measured, on the loop carrying the
  microphone), and BORROWED from a live agent when one already has it
  initialized — never shut down in that case, because it is that
  agent's.

### Fixed
- A case-variant known section name (`"memory"`) matched neither the
  ordered list nor the extras, so it vanished from the prompt entirely
  rather than rendering out of order.

### Known gaps
- Nothing is written back when a call ends (#9), and every speaker in a
  Discord channel is still treated as the operator (#10).

## [0.7.0] — 2026-08-04

Talk to it in the Discord voice channel Hermes is already sitting in.
`/talk join` turns that channel into a live duplex call — it hears you
while it speaks, you can cut it off mid-sentence, and you can delegate
and steer background agents out loud. Verified on a real call: the
session connected on `gpt-realtime-2.1` over a ChatGPT subscription,
heard the operator, answered, and spawned a background agent by voice.

### Added
- **Discord voice** (`talk_discord.py`). The plugin's audio device is
  seven methods wide, so a voice channel can wear the same shape a
  microphone does — the session, tool calls, steering ledger and
  announcements above it are unchanged.
- `/talk join` / `leave` / `status` inside the gateway. Outside it,
  `/talk` still means the terminal call.

### Changed
- **No second Discord connection.** The host already holds one and
  already decrypts DAVE; the plugin borrows it, so it is one bot, one
  connection, the host's own E2EE. For the duration of a call it takes
  over three host surfaces and returns them on stop — with one documented
  exception: the ambient mixer is dropped rather than handed back,
  because taking over playback closes it permanently and a closed mixer
  still reports itself speaking, which would stall every later host reply.
- Rate conversion is integer 2:1 both ways over `array` — no resampler
  dependency, and specifically no `audioop`, which left the stdlib in 3.13.

### Fixed
Four defects that only a real call could surface, each now pinned by a
regression whose fake models the host's actual behaviour:
- the receive tap was never registered (discord.py stores the bound
  method object and calls what it stored, so rebinding the attribute
  tapped nothing — the call heard silence with nothing logged);
- the playback source was duck-typed where `VoiceClient.play`
  isinstance-checks;
- the adapter lookup imported `Platform` from a module this host does not
  have, so it refused on a healthy gateway;
- capture forwarded only what Discord sent, so during a pause the
  server's turn detection never saw the silence that ends a turn.

## [0.6.1] — 2026-08-03

The polish release: the stop verbs can no longer dead-air the call, and
their receipts survive you hanging up. Closes #2 and #5. One adversarial
review round found three gaps (receipt durability, a reaped-handle race,
announcement interleaving) — all reconciled in-release. 390 tests.

### Changed
- `stop_work` runs its confirmation on daemon workers with a bounded 1.5s
  courtesy wait: the common fast path still speaks the real result, a slow
  server gets honest detached wording, and the voice loop never freezes
  (the old synchronous path could block it ~6s).
- `terminate()` is now confirmed, not just signaled: the exit code is read
  from a handle captured before the signal (immune to the run worker
  reaping the child first), and the run record is consulted before any
  uncertainty claim is spoken.
- All out-of-band announcements (finished children, landed notes) flow
  through one serialized pump — whole batches, deferred while a response
  is in flight, so concurrent events can never interleave or stack active
  responses.

### Added
- Landed steering notes are now **pushed**: the moment a note's delivery
  artifact fires, the live call hears "the note just landed" instead of
  waiting for the next `check_work`.
- Stop receipts persist to the run history (`annotate_run(tee=True)`), so
  a receipt promised past the courtesy wait survives a process restart and
  the next session's `check_work` can still keep the promise.
- `uninstall_watchers()` — a production unhook symmetric with the two
  `ensure_*` calls; the borrowed logger level is reconciled on every
  ensure (operator verbose-logging toggles are honored both directions).

## [0.6.0] — 2026-08-03

The release where delivery confirmation stopped having a blind spot, and
the plugin gained a stronger verb than a queued note. Gate chain: 368
tests + ruff → two Codex adversarial rounds (six findings, all
reconciled) → Kimi K3 design gate PASS — "every mechanism degrades toward
less information, never toward a wrong claim."

### Added
- **Second delivery artifact**: a watcher on the host's pre-API steer
  drain. Notes delivered right before a model request used to terminate
  as false "unconfirmed"; they now land. Attribution is by frame identity
  against the agent captured at steer time — exact, never heuristic.
- **Push lifecycle**: `subagent_start`/`subagent_stop` hooks roster
  children by session id; completions are announced into the live call
  the moment the host reports them (injection-contained: system-role
  item, `tool_choice: "none"`, self-deleting in the same batch).
- **`redirect_agent`** — interrupt a child's current step and re-aim it
  now ("stop, wrong repo"), on the 0.20-public `AIAgent.redirect()`. The
  receipt comes from the return value; the wording never claims more than
  the host guarantees. Degrades to the steer queue on pre-0.20 hosts.
- **Correlation tokens** (closes #1): every note travels as
  `[tk-xxxxxxxx] note` and delivery matching is token-first — two agents
  holding identical text can never land each other's receipts.

### Fixed
- The v0.5 wheel silently omitted `talk_steer` from `py-modules` — the
  exact trap the pyproject comment warns about, caught in the wild.
- The dashboard manifest version had been stuck at 0.3.0.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-08-03

`steer_run` was retired for telling comfortable lies; this is the surface
that replaced it. Three reviews, one verdict: it claimed delivery the
substrate cannot know. v2 speaks only what an artifact proves.

### Added
- Run-control surface: `list_agents` (discovery-first ids), `steer_agent`
  (queued is the only call-time claim), `stop_work` (the one verb every
  lane supports — and every "want me to stop it?" offer is real).
- The receipt ledger (`talk_steer`): queued → landed / unconfirmed /
  missed / superseded, each state upgraded only by a named artifact
  (the host's own drain log line, watched in-process).

### Removed
- `steer_run` — replaced by the surface above.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-08-02

The under-named release: its title was the steering verb, but the same
window shipped the browser dashboard and the api-server agent lane.

### Added
- `steer_run` — redirect a live background agent by voice (superseded in
  0.5.0 by the honest surface).
- **Dashboard tab**: the browser voice page — WebRTC audio, tool relay,
  run watcher, voice picker, and its own token gate
  (`TALK_DASHBOARD_TOKEN`; loopback-only when unset). Four backend routes
  under `/api/plugins/hermes-talk/`, every one auth-gated by construction.
- **Three-tier agent chain**: attached in-process loop → a real agent
  over the api_server platform → detached `hermes -z` one-shot; every
  fall-through announced, the active lane reported by `talk_status`.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-08-02

Sessions that start already knowing you: the host's identity files ride
the session instructions, budgeted and trimmed, so the first sentence out
of the model isn't from a stranger.

### Added
- Voice identity assembly with per-section budgets and the
  `TALK_IDENTITY_INCLUDE` knob (REPLACES the default set — the trap is
  documented where the knob is).
- The autoplaying dashboard demo in the README, recorded from a real
  session (hosted on this release's page).

## [0.2.0] — 2026-08-02

Background delegation that speaks its results: hand work off mid-sentence,
keep talking, and hear the result the moment it lands — even if you went
quiet.

### Added
- `delegate_task` / `check_work` and the async-run registry with a
  durable, honest history tail (a run from a dead process reports `lost`,
  never "still running").
- Dual-lane credentials: an OpenAI API key or a ChatGPT subscription via
  Codex OAuth — resolved fail-closed, and only the ephemeral session
  secret ever touches the socket.
- The offline test suite (82 tests then) and CI across
  {ubuntu, windows} × {3.11, 3.12, 3.13} — no secrets, no network, no
  audio device.

### Fixed
- GA Realtime protocol compliance (session.type on every update; the
  retired beta header dropped) and honest process exit codes.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-08-02

Repo foundation: the plugin manifest, call-time config resolution, and a
pure Realtime wire layer that knows the OpenAI protocol and nothing about
the host.
